Common coding guidelines we use:
1. Don't create empty folders before you actually need it. Instead, follow the proposed project structure during the development of the project and when you create new files.
2. When a project has a backend use `src/services/api.ts` for API calls, use a request payload and a response objects from `src/DTO.ts`.
