### UI Design :design:

## Grid system guidelines
* Use a 12-column grid system as the foundation.
* Define gutters (spacing between columns) and margins (spacing outside the grid).
* Maintain consistent gutters (typically 16px/24px/32px).

### Align Components
* Snap all components (buttons, cards, text, images) to the grid. Avoid positioning elements randomly.
* Ensure spacing between components is consistent and proportional to the grid's baseline.

### Spacing System
* Follow an 8-point grid system (8px increments)
* Use standardized spacing values:
- 4px (0.25rem) - Micro spacing
- 8px (0.5rem) - Small elements
- 16px (1rem) - Standard spacing
- 24px (1.5rem) - Medium components
- 32px (2rem) - Large sections
- 48px (3rem) - Major sections
- 64px (4rem) - Page-level spacing

## Container Rules
* Auto margins for centering
* Consistent padding on container edges is 32px

## Component Layout
* Use CSS Grid for two-dimensional layouts
* Flexbox for one-dimensional arrangements
* Maintain consistent aspect ratios for media
* Implement gap-based spacing between grid items

## Grid types to consider
* Single Column: For minimalistic layouts or focused content.
* Multi-Column (e.g., 12-column): For layouts needing flexibility and variation.
* Modular Grids (e.g., square modules): For uniform card layouts or gallery designs.

## Accessibility Considerations
* Ensure readable line lengths (45-75 characters)
* Preserve proper content hierarchy
